I hope to contribute to our understanding of the Earth system using two key methodologies: high-precision geochronology and high-performance computing

Geochronology
======
Time is the fundamental independent variable of the natural sciences — the one one variable whose variation cannot be impeded or reversed — and as such has a unique ability to unite disparate fields of Earth science through quantifying rates, establishing temporal correlations, and testing causal links. In particular, high temporal precision geochronology is crucial to our understanding of processes ranging from mass extinctions to magmatic differentiation.

Computation
======
Where geochronology allows us to quantify the passage of time with great precision extending to geologically rapid timescales, computation and modeling allow us to (1) elucidate the temporal variation of fundamental Earth system variables that may be obscured by crustal heterogeneity but that have changed over geologically long timescales (2) simulate the operation of Earth system processes in the inaccessible past and over vast geologic timescales. A range of open questions in solid-earth geochemistry are well-suited to high-performance computation, providing both inherently parallelism and a massive parameter space to explore. From inversion for the conditions of magmatic differentiation to comprehensive forward modeling of crustal geochemical evolution,  many key problems are well-suited to hierarchical parallelization, allowing for efficient scaling.
