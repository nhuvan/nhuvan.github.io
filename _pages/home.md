<!-- Welcome to my website.<br/>
I'm a Computer Vision and Machine Learning researcher at the ANR S.A.I.L Lab, University of La Rochelle.

<!-- ### BIO: -->

<!-- I completed my PhD in Computer Vision in 10/2011 under the supervisor of prof. Jean-Marc Ogier, prof. AUF Alain Boucher and prof. Salvatore Tabbone. From 11/2011 to 09/2014 I worked with prof. Jean-Marc Ogier on multimodal indexing for lecture videos. In 2014, the SATT Grand Center chose my invention (the PEDIVHANDI project) for its technology transfer program. From 10/2014 to 04/2016, I focused on this new project (employee at La SATT). From 05/2016 to 08/2018, I worked in the eBD team of prof. Jean-Christophe Burie, doing research on the comic book images analysis using hybric methods (deep learning and traditional image processing/computer vision techniques). From 09/2018, I have been working with prof. Jean-Christophe Burie, prof. Arnaud Revel and prof Karell Bertet in the joint lab S.A.I.L. In this context, I work mainly on the  semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning methods.<br/>
My research focuses on two themes: -->

<!-- I obtained my Phd Computer Vision in 10/2011 at the University of La Rochelle, under the supervisor of Prof. Jean-Marc Ogier, Prof. AUF Alain Boucher and Prof. Salvatore Tabbone. After that, I worked with Prof. Jean-Marc Ogier on multimodal indexing for lecture videos for PEDIVHANDI project, for which I was awarded with SATT sponsorship within its technology transfer program in October, 2014. Our lecture videos indexing system from PEDIVHANDI project is protected by the APP (https://www.app.asso.fr/en). From 2016 I have focused more on the deep learning approach for the field of computer vision and document analysis. I worked in the e-BDthèque team, led by Prof. Jean-Christophe Burie, doing research on the comic book images analysis using hybrid methods. From 09/2018, I have played a key role in developing the joint lab S.A.I.L., leading research projects related to the deep learning approach with Prof. Jean-Christophe Burie, Prof. Arnaud Revel and Prof. Karell Bertet. -->

I obtained my Phd in Computer Vision at the University of La Rochelle, under the supervision of Prof. Jean-Marc Ogier.  I was awarded the SATT sponsorship within its technology transfer program for my work on  on multimodal indexing for lecture videos. Since 2016 I have developed my research path towards the deep learning approach for computer vision and document analysis. I played a key role in developing the joint lab S.A.I.L., leading research projects related to the deep learning approach. From 10/2020, I started to work with Prof. Véronique Eglin at the lab LIRIS, UMR 5205 CNRS, INSA Lyon.
My research interests covers two main themes:
+ Multimodal analysis.
+ Machine learning (focusing on multimodale and semi-/weakly supervised learning).

### Professional and Community roles:

I am experienced in building real IT systems, especially in building AI products. I have experience as an entrepreneur (co-founder of the startup [BrickIn'Up](/administratives/101-bup/), France) and as an advisor for companies worldwide, including an insurtech AI Startup in Germany, two AI solutions companies in Vietnam.

I am one of key members of the Association of Vietnamese Scientists and Experts ([AVSE Global](http://www.avseglobal.org/)), headquartered in Paris. I have contributed to organizing innovative events gathering Vietnamese excellences all over the world.
