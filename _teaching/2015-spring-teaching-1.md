As a fifth-year graduate student, I acted as TA for Prof. Blair Schoene's petrology course, where I developed new lab assignments, guided students in selecting and developing independent group research projects, and integrated the mapping and sampling components of student projects into our week-long course field trip. Upon our return, students conducted a range of analyses on field samples, including whole-rock geochemistry by solution ICPMS, thin section petrology, and carbonate isotopic analyses. Several lab sections were devoted to assisting students in completing these analyses and preparing final reports.
