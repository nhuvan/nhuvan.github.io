title: "Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-Samperton-etal-2015
excerpt: 'Collaborative work with Kyle Samperton, who conducted high-precision geochronology of the Bergell Intrusion coupled with geochemical analyses on the same zircon volume (by TIMS-TEA). The results revealed clear temporal trends over approximately 1.5 Ma of emplacement and differentiation, which we interpreted in the context of global differentiation trends.'
