title: "Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-04-20-Keller-Boehnke-Schoene-2017
excerpt: 'We investigate the variation in the amount of zircon expected to saturate from magmas of different ages throughout Earth history. We find that older magmas crystallize substantially less zircon per unit mass due to the geochemical consequences of secular mantle cooling  -- suggesting that a larger volume of felsic magmatism is required to explain the Archean (and perhaps the Hadean) zircon record than previously considered. We note also that anorthosite flotation crust is largely zircon free and thus invisible to zircon-based crustal growth models, with implications explored in the supplement.'
