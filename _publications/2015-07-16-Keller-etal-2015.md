title: "Volcanicâ€“plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-07-16-Keller-etal-2015
excerpt: 'Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion.'
