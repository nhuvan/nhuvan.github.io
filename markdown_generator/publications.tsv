2012-05-24	Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago	Nature	My first significant computational work - originally a side project to work on as a grad student while waiting for Blair's clean lab to be built. We were surprised by the strength and consistency of the geochemical trends we observed on Gyr timescales. The simplest signals directly reflect secular mantle cooling, but others hint at a change in crustal evolution that appears to coincide temporally with oxidation of the surface Earth in the Great Oxygenation Event.

2015-10-01	Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust	Nature	Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion.

2015-10-01	Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps	Chemical Geology	Collaborative work with Kyle Samperton, who conducted high-precision geochronology of the Bergell Intrusion coupled with geochemical analyses on the same zircon volume (by TIMS-TEA). The results revealed clear temporal trends over approximately 1.5 Ma of emplacement and differentiation, which we interpreted in the context of global differentiation trends.	"Your Name, You. (2015).
