2010-05-01	Chemical Constraints on the Origin of the Frailes Volcanic Complex in the Central Andean Altiplano Plateau, Bolivia	B.S. Thesis, Cornell University	advisor: Suzanne Mahlburg Kay	C. Brenhin Keller	Keller, C.B. (2010). <i>Chemical Constraints on the Origin of the Frailes Volcanic Complex in the Central Andean Altiplano Plateau, Bolivia</i>.  B.S. Thesis, Cornell University. doi: 10.31237/osf.io/y6kv4	The Frailes volcanic complex of the Bolivian Altiplano plateau is the largest and most prominent ignimbrite of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone. With 2000 km3 of exposed volcanic deposits dating from 25 Ma to the present, the complex provides insight into the processes of large-volume silicic melt formation in a back-arc setting. However, the voluminous 0-10 Ma main body of the Frailes complex remains poorly studied, as the majority of the literature focuses on a small region of 12-14 Ma Sn-Ag mineralization at Cerro Rico – the world's largest silver deposit. Here, we present geochemical analyses of 25 representative samples from our fieldwork on the Frailes ignimbrite. Whole-rock major element analysis by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy showed the ~ 7 Ma samples to be highly peraluminous, potassic (>5% K2O) andesitic to rhyodacitic welded volcanic tuffs with an Al-rich, chemically reduced mineral assemblage including biotite, calcic feldspar, magmatic cordierite, and ilmenite. Trace element analysis by instrumental neutron activation revealed steep rare earth patterns with Sm/Yb > 5.0, requiring the presence of garnet in a deep-crustal, high-pressure restitic assemblage. In contrast, the presence of cordierite indicates crystallization at low pressure (< 450 MPa), at depths of less than 14 km. In addition, geochemical analyses combined with the geocronological work of Barke et al. (2007) support a recent (~2 Ma) age for the ignimbrites of the main Frailes Meseta. These ignimbrites are consequently best explained by mixing of a mantle- derived melt with a reduced, lower crustal component at great depths to produce hybrid magmas that ascended and evolved to form shallow crustal (<14 km) magma bodies before erupting in catastrophic, caldera-forming events at ~2 Ma.	https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/y6kv4					Keller-thesis-2010
2012-05-24	Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago	Nature	My first significant computational work - originally a side project to work on as a grad student while waiting for Blair's clean lab to be built. We were surprised by the strength and consistency of the geochemical trends we observed on Gyr timescales. The simplest signals directly reflect secular mantle cooling, but others hint at a change in crustal evolution that appears to coincide temporally with oxidation of the surface Earth in the Great Oxygenation Event.	C. Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene.	Keller, C.B. & Schoene, B. (2012). Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago. <i>Nature</i> 485, 490–493.	The Earth has cooled over the past 4.5 billion years (Gyr) as a result of surface heat loss and declining radiogenic heat production. Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archaean geodynamics, but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias. Here we apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of about 70,000 samples from the continental igneous rock record to produce a comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity occurring about 2.5 Gyr ago, involving substantial decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in indicators of deep crustal melting and fractionation, such as Na/K, Eu/Eu* (europium anomaly) and La/Yb ratios in felsic rocks. Along with an increase in preserved crustal thickness across the Archaean/Proterozoic boundary, these data are consistent with a model in which high-degree Archaean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and melting—leading to abundant tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite magmatism and a thin preserved Archaean crust. The coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation at the end of the Archaean eon provides a significant temporal link between deep Earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth.	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11024	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KS2012Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/p9hk2		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry	Keller-Schoene-2012
2015-07-16	Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust	Nature	Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion. This paper was my first foray into high-performance computing, running ~1.3 million pMELTS simulations to invert for P-T paths and water contents that produce differentiation trends similar to the those observed in the natural dataset.

Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust. <i>Nature</i> 523, 301–307.	The continental crust is central to the biological and geological history of Earth. However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical comparison of its primary igneous building blocks—volcanic and plutonic rocks—and the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas, emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation.	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14584	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSBSH2015Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/63ycb		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/VolcanicPlutonic	Keller-etal-2015
2015-10-01	Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps	Chemical Geology	-------	Kyle M. Samperton, Blair Schoene, John M. Cottle, C. Brenhin Keller, James L. Crowley, and Mark D. Schmitz.	Samperton, K.M., Schoene, B., Cottle, J.M., Keller, C.B., Crowley, J.L., and Schmitz, M.D. (2015) Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps. <i>Chemical Geology</i> 417, 322–340.	U–Th–Pb zircon geochronology is an essential tool for quantifying the emplacement, differentiation and thermal evolution of crustal magmatic systems. However, the power of U–Pb zircon dates can be enhanced through complementary characterization of mineral texture and geochemistry, as this permits more detailed interpretations of geochronological datasets than conventionally achieved. Our approach to better relating zircon dates and geological processes consists of a multi-method analytical workflow, including cathodoluminescence imaging (CL), in situ LA-ICPMS/EPMA zircon geochemistry, U–Pb zircon ID-TIMS geochronology, and solution ICPMS zircon Trace Element Analysis (U–Pb TIMS-TEA). These methods are here applied to zircon from the Bergell Intrusion, a composite Alpine pluton preserving a ~ 10 km mid-crustal transect. Hand samples of tonalite, granodiorite and hybridized granitoid each record 250–700 kyr of autocrystic zircon growth. Bergell zircons are ubiquitously zoned with ca. 10^4–10^6 yr growth histories, as evidenced by ID-TIMS analysis of microsampled fragments from single crystals. U–Pb TIMS-TEA data exhibit compositional trends on multiple spatiotemporal scales, including the handsample-scale, representing in situ differentiation at the emplacement level (e.g., Th/U); lithology-scale, defining trajectories corresponding to the production of tonalitic versus granodioritic magmas (Lu/Hf); and pluton-scale, indicating increasingly-evolved melts over ~1.6 Myr of pluton assembly (Zr/Hf). These absolute TIMS-TEA temporal trends are corroborated by relative LA-ICPMS/EPMA core-to-rim geochemistry. We compare records of trace element evolution from TIMS-TEA, Bergell whole-rock geochemistry, and a global compilation of whole-rock geochemical data. These findings support zircon compositional evolution as a robust indicator of differentiation at local and crustal scales, and provide key empirical constraints on melt differentiation and cooling timescales in the middle crust.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2015.10.024					Samperton-etal-2015
2016-02-24	Zircon record of the plutonic-volcanic connection and protracted rhyolite melt evolution	Geology	-------	Chad D. Deering, C. Brenhin Keller, Blair Schoene, Olivier Bachmann, Rachel Beane, and Maria Ovtcharova	Deering, C.D., Keller, C.B., Schoene, B., Bachmann, O., Beane, R., & Ovtcharova, M. (2016) Zircon Record of the Plutonic-Volcanic Connection and Protracted Rhyolite Melt Extraction. <i>Geology</i> 44 (4), 267-270.	The potential petrogenetic link between a crystal-poor rhyolite (the Rhyolite Canyon Tuff) and its associated subvolcanic intrusion and crystal-rich post-caldera lavas from Turkey Creek, Arizona (USA), is examined using zircon chemical abrasion–thermal ionization mass spectrometry U-Pb geochronology and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry trace element analyses. U-Pb ages indicate that zircon growth within the rhyolite and the dacite-monzonite porphyry magmas was coeval over ∼300 k.y. prior to the large eruptive event. Trends in zircon trace elements (Hf, Y/Dy, Sm/Yb, Eu/Eu*) through time in the dacitic-monzonitic units and rhyolite reflect melt evolution dominated by crystal fractionation. Importantly, the Y/Dy ratio in zircons in both units remains mostly similar for the first ∼150 k.y. of the system’s evolution, but the dominant population in the rhyolitic unit diverges from that of the dacite-monzonite porphyry ∼150 k.y. before eruption. We interpret this divergence in trace element composition to record the assembly time of the melt-rich cap within its intermediate mush zone in the upper crustal reservoir. These results are consistent with (1) a connection between plutonic and volcanic realms in the upper crust, (2) a protracted time scale for constructing an intermediate mush large enough to hold 500 km3 of rhyolite, and (3) the prolonged extraction of that melt prior to eruption.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G37539.1					Deering-etal-2016
2016-11-15	Geochemical Evolution of Earth’s Continental Crust	Ph.D. Dissertation, Princeton University	advisor: Blair Schoene	C. Brenhin Keller	Keller, C.B. (2016). <i>Geochemical Evolution of Earth’s Continental Crust</i>.  PhD Dissertation, Princeton University. doi: 10.31237/osf.io/q7yra	Earth’s unique continental crust represents the active interface between the deep earth and the surface earth system, and is crucial for the survival and diversification of life on Earth, both as a source for nutrients and a component in the silicate weathering feedback that stabilizes Earth’s equable climate on billion-year timescales. However, many open questions remain regarding the formation and secular temporal evolution of Earth’s crust – in part due to the extremely poorly-mixed nature of Earth’s continental crust such that compositional heterogeneity at any one point in geologic time typically dwarfs any systematic variation over time. New computational approaches enabled by the emergence of large, freely accessible geochemical datasets provide a way to see through this heterogeneity and extract quantitative information about underlying processes and variables that drive the evolution of Earth’s crust over geologic time.	https://doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/q7yra					Keller-dissertation-2016

McKeegan	Barboni, M., Boehnke, P., Keller, C.B., Kohl, I., Schoene, B., Young, E.D., and McKeegan, K.D. (2017) Early Formation of the Moon 4.51 billion years ago. <i>Science Advances</i> 3, e1602365. 	Establishing the age of the Moon is critical to understanding solar system evolution and the formation of rocky planets, including Earth. However, despite its importance, the age of the Moon has never been accurately determined. We present uranium-lead dating of Apollo 14 zircon fragments that yield highly precise, concordant ages, demonstrating that they are robust against postcrystallization isotopic disturbances. Hafnium isotopic analyses of the same fragments show extremely low initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios corrected for cosmic ray exposure that are near the solar system initial value. Our data indicate differentiation of the lunar crust by 4.51 billion years, indicating the formation of the Moon within the first ~60 million years after the birth of the solar system.	https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1602365					Barboni-etal-2017
2017-04-20	Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history	Geochemical Perspectives Letters	Here we investigated the variation in the amount of zircon expected to saturate from magmas of different ages throughout Earth history by running full MELTS simulations along with trace element partitioning calculations (on a local Princeton University cluster) for each of the ~70,000 samples in the Keller & Schoene (2012) dataset. We found that older magmas crystallize substantially less zircon per unit mass due to the geochemical consequences of secular mantle cooling  -- suggesting that a larger volume of felsic magmatism is required to explain the Archean (and perhaps the Hadean) zircon record than previously considered. We note also that anorthosite flotation crust is largely zircon free and thus invisible to zircon-based crustal growth models, with implications explored in the supplement. 	C. Brenhin Keller, Patrick Boehnke, and Blair Schoene	Keller, C.B., Boehnke, P., and Schoene, B. (2017) Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. <i>Geochemical Perspectives Letters</i> 3, 179-189.	Zircon is the preeminent chronometer of deep time on Earth, informing models of crustal growth and providing our only direct window into the Hadean Eon. However, the quantity of zircon crystallised per unit mass of magma is highly variable, complicating interpretation of the terrestrial zircon record. Here we combine zircon saturation simulations with a dataset of ∼52,000 igneous whole rock geochemical analyses to quantify secular variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. We find dramatically increasing zircon abundance per mass of magma through geologic time, suggesting that the zircon record underestimates past crustal volume even if preservation bias is eliminated. Similarly, zircons were even less likely to crystallise from low-silica magmas in early Earth history than they are today, together suggesting that the observed Hadean zircon record may require a larger volume of generally felsic Hadean crust than previously expected.	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1721	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBS2017Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/cj8eu	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBS2017.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/meltstzirc	Keller-Boehnke-Schoene-2017
2017-07-10	Complementary crystal accumulation and rhyolite melt segregation in a late Miocene Andean pluton	Geology	-------	Allen J. Schaen, John M. Cottle, Brad S. Singer, C. Brenhin Keller, Nicolas Garibaldi, and Blair Schoene	Schaen, A.J., Cottle, J.M., Singer, B.S., Garbaldi, N., Keller, C.B., and Schoene, B. (2017) Complementary crystal accumulation and rhyolite melt segregation in late Miocene Andean plutons. <i>Geology</i> 45 (9), 835-838.	High-silica granites are hypothesized to form via fractionation in the shallow crust, yet the predicted residues are rarely identified and can be difficult to distinguish within plutons whose rocks otherwise plot along liquid lines of descent. Bulk-rock compositional mass balance in the late Miocene Risco Bayo–Huemul plutonic complex (Chile) suggests that lithological differences within the Huemul pluton reflect residual crystal concentration in response to melt extraction. A compositional gap from 70 to 75 wt% SiO2 and strong depletion in Ba and Eu suggest that Huemul alkali feldspar (Afs) granites are frozen remnants of highly evolved rhyolitic melt extracted from a mush. Quartz monzonites enriched in Zr and Ba with Eu/Eu* near unity are interpreted to represent the complementary residual silicic cumulates of this fractionation process. Compositional variations in Afs granite zircon (Eu/Eu*, Dy/Yb) further support extraction of this melt from a zircon-saturated mush. U-Pb zircon dates indicate that Huemul rocks evolved ∼800 k.y. after initial crystallization of more mafic Risco Bayo rocks, likely precluding their evolution via fractionation from mafic forerunners. This pluton records a means to produce rhyolite in the upper crust, which has propelled large silicic eruptions during the Quaternary within the Andean subduction zone.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G39167.1					Schaen-etal-2017
2017-08-23	Zircon age-temperature-compositional spectra in plutonic rocks	Geology	-------	Kyle M. Samperton, Elizabeth A. Bell, Mélanie Barboni, C. Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene	Samperton, K.M., Bell., E.A., Barboni., M., Keller, C.B., and Schoene, B. (2017) Zircon age–temperature–compositional spectra in plutonic rocks. <i>Geology</i> 45 (11), 983–986.	Geochronology can resolve dispersed zircon dates in plutonic rocks when magma cooling time scales exceed the temporal precision of individual U-Pb analyses; such age heterogeneity may indicate protracted crystallization between the temperatures of zircon saturation (Tsat) and rock solidification (Tsolid). Diffusive growth models predict asymmetric distributions of zircon dates and crystallization temperatures in a cooling magma, with volumetrically abundant old, hot crystallization at Tsat decreasing continuously to volumetrically minor young, cold crystallization at Tsolid. We present integrated geochronological and geochemical data from Bergell Intrusion tonalites (Central Alps, Europe) that document zircon compositional change over hundreds of thousands of years at the hand-sample scale, indicating melt compositional evolution during solidification. Ti-in-zircon thermometry, crystallization simulation using MELTS software, and U-Pb dates produce zircon mass-temperature-time distributions that are in excellent agreement with zircon growth models. These findings provide the first quantitative validation of longstanding expectations from zircon saturation theory by direct geochronological investigation, underscoring zircon’s capacity to quantify supersolidus cooling rates in magmas and resolve dynamic differentiation histories in the plutonic rock record.	https://doi.org/10.1130/G38645.1					Samperton-etal-2017
2018-01-01	Plate tectonics and continental basaltic geochemistry throughout Earth history	Earth and Planetary Science Letters	In this longer-format paper we examine in detail the record of basaltic rocks preserved in the continental crust, building on the weighted bootstrap resampling procedure of Keller and Schoene, 2012. A range of rapid trace element variations in the basaltic record can be explained as a result of mantle melting systematics (changing partition coefficients as a result of Grt and Cpx-out). Both trace element signatures of slab fluid input and major element signatures of calc-alkaline vs tholeiitic differentiation are remarkably stable and consistently arc-like, strongly suggesting the occurence of subduction and plate tectonics throughout the preserved rock record (back to at least 3.85 Ga). While some non-plate tectonic models may produce some flux melting, a virtually constant proportion of flux to decompression melting in the preserved continental record is a tall order for any non-plate model for Archean tectonics. 	Brenhin Keller and Blair Schoene.	Keller, C.B. & Schoene, B. (2018) Plate tectonics and continental basaltic geochemistry throughout Earth history. <i>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</i> 481, 290-304.	Basaltic magmas constitute the primary mass flux from Earth's mantle to its crust, carrying information about the conditions of mantle melting through which they were generated. As such, changes in the average basaltic geochemistry through time reflect changes in underlying parameters such as mantle potential temperature and the geodynamic setting of mantle melting. However, sampling bias, preservation bias, and geological heterogeneity complicate the calculation of representative average compositions. Here we use weighted bootstrap resampling to minimize sampling bias over the heterogeneous rock record and obtain maximally representative average basaltic compositions through time. Over the approximately 4 Ga of the continental rock record, the average composition of preserved continental basalts has evolved along a generally continuous trajectory, with decreasing compatible element concentrations and increasing incompatible element concentrations, punctuated by a comparatively rapid transition in some variables such as La/Yb ratios and Zr, Nb, and Ti abundances approximately 2.5 Ga ago. Geochemical modeling of mantle melting systematics and trace element partitioning suggests that these observations can be explained by discontinuous changes in the mineralogy of mantle partial melting driven by a gradual decrease in mantle potential temperature, without appealing to any change in tectonic process. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical record of slab fluid input to continental basalts, which indicates no long-term change in the global proportion of arc versus non-arc basaltic magmatism at any time in the preserved rock record.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.10.031	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KS2018Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/afyxs		https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry	Keller-Schoene-2018
2018-01-03	A record of deep-ocean dissolved O2 from the oxidation state of iron in submarine basalts	Nature	[<u>UC Berkeley press release</u>](http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/01/03/which-came-first-complex-life-or-high-atmospheric-oxygen/)	Daniel A. Stolper and C. Brenhin Keller	Stolper, D.A. & Keller, C.B. (2018). A record of deep-ocean dissolved O2 from the oxidation state of iron in submarine basalts. <i>Nature</i> 553, 323–327.	The oxygenation of the deep ocean in the geological past has been associated with a rise in the partial pressure of atmospheric molecular oxygen (O2) to near-present levels and the emergence of modern marine biogeochemical cycles. It has also been linked to the origination and diversification of early animals. It is generally thought that the deep ocean was largely anoxic from about 2,500 to 800 million years ago, with estimates of the occurrence of deep-ocean oxygenation and the linked increase in the partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen to levels sufficient for this oxygenation ranging from about 800 to 400 million years ago. Deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations over this interval are typically estimated using geochemical signatures preserved in ancient continental shelf or slope sediments, which only indirectly reflect the geochemical state of the deep ocean. Here we present a record that more directly reflects deep-ocean oxygen concentrations, based on the ratio of Fe3+ to total Fe in hydrothermally altered basalts formed in ocean basins. Our data allow for quantitative estimates of deep-ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations from 3.5 billion years ago to 14 million years ago and suggest that deep-ocean oxygenation occurred in the Phanerozoic (541 million years ago to the present) and potentially not until the late Palaeozoic (less than 420 million years ago).	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25009					Stolper-Keller-2018

The composition of the crust and volatiles migrating through it directly influence the makeup of the atmosphere, the composition of seawater, and nutrient availability. Despite its importance, there is little known and less agreed upon regarding the nature of the Hadean crust. By analyzing the 87Sr/86 Sr ratio of apatite inclusions in Archean zircons from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, we show that its protolith had formed a high (> 1) Rb/Sr ratio reservoir by at least 4.2 Ga. This result implies that the early crust had a broad range of igneous rocks, extending from mafic to highly silicic compositions.	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1720880115					Boehnke-etal-2018

The 238U decay constant (λU-238) is fundamental to radioisotope-based chronometry in the Earth and planetary sciences, yet only a single published λU-238 value (Jaffey et al. in Phys Rev C 4(5):1889–1906, 1971) is widely applied. We have determined λU-238 via the novel approach of measuring of 234Th ingrowth in high-purity 238U solutions, using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS). The 234Th decay constant (λTh-234) was measured via decay counting with high-purity Ge (HPGe) γ detectors. Preliminary results for λU-238 agree with the value determined by α-counting within the elevated uncertainty of 0.462% (k = 2). Ongoing efforts to reproduce λU-238 with reduced experimental uncertainties will inform future conclusions.	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10967-018-6148-y					Parsons-Davis-etal-2018

(2018) A Stochastic Sampling Approach to Zircon Eruption Age Interpretation. <i>Geochemical Persectives Letters</i> 8, 31-35	The accessory mineral zircon is widely used to constrain the timing of igneous processes such as magma crystallisation or eruption. However, zircon U-Pb ages record zircon crystallisation, which is not an instantaneous process. Zircon saturation calculations link zircon crystallisation, temperature, and melt fraction, allowing for the estimation of zircon crystallisation distributions as a function of time or temperature. Such distributions provide valuable prior information, enabling Bayesian estimates of magma eruption time and allowing for comparison of the relative accuracy of common weighted-mean and youngest-zircon age interpretations with synthetic datasets. We find that both traditional interpretations carry a risk of underestimating the uncertainty in eruption age; a low mean square of weighted deviates (MSWD) does not guarantee the accuracy of weighted-mean interpretations. In the absence of independent confirmation that crystallisation timescale is short relative to analytical uncertainties, a Bayesian approach frequently provides the most accurate results and is least likely to underestimate uncertainty. Since U-Pb zircon studies now routinely resolve geological age dispersion due to increasing analytical precision, such considerations are increasingly critical to future progress in resolving rates and dates of Earth processes.	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1826	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSS2018Preprint.pdf	https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/aws79	https://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KSS2018.pdf	https://github.com/brenhinkeller/BayeZirChron.c	Keller-Schoene-Samperton-2018
