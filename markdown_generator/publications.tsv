2012-05-24	Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago	Nature	My first significant computational work - originally a side project to work on as a grad student while waiting for Blair's clean lab to be built. We were surprised by the strength and consistency of the geochemical trends we observed on Gyr timescales. The simplest signals directly reflect secular mantle cooling, but others hint at a change in crustal evolution that appears to coincide temporally with oxidation of the surface Earth in the Great Oxygenation Event.

2015-07-16	Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust	Nature	Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion.

2015-10-01	Magma emplacement, differentiation and cooling in the middle crust: Integrated zircon geochronological–geochemical constraints from the Bergell Intrusion, Central Alps	Chemical Geology	Collaborative work with Kyle Samperton, who conducted high-precision geochronology of the Bergell Intrusion coupled with geochemical analyses on the same zircon volume (by TIMS-TEA). The results revealed clear temporal trends over approximately 1.5 Ma of emplacement and differentiation, which we interpreted in the context of global differentiation trends obtained by the approach of Keller et al 2015.

2016-02-24	Zircon record of the plutonic-volcanic connection and protracted rhyolite melt evolution	Geology	Collaborative work with Chad Deering and others. My contribution centered on the acquisition of CA-ID-TIMS-TEA data, which confirmed a coeval relationship between units identified as cumulates and extracted melts. 	Chad D. Deering, C.

2017-04-20	Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history	Geochemical Perspectives Letters	We investigate the variation in the amount of zircon expected to saturate from magmas of different ages throughout Earth history. We find that older magmas crystallize substantially less zircon per unit mass due to the geochemical consequences of secular mantle cooling  -- suggesting that a larger volume of felsic magmatism is required to explain the Archean (and perhaps the Hadean) zircon record than previously considered. We note also that anorthosite flotation crust is largely zircon free and thus invisible to zircon-based crustal growth models, with implications explored in the supplement.	C.

(2017) Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. <i>Geochemical Perspectives Letters</i> 3, 179-189.	Keller-Boehnke-Schoene-2017	https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.1721	http://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KBS2017.pdf	"""<i>Zircon is the preeminent chronometer of deep time on Earth, informing models of crustal growth and providing our only direct window into the Hadean Eon. However, the quantity of zircon crystallised per unit mass of magma is highly variable, complicating interpretation of the terrestrial zircon record. Here we combine zircon saturation simulations with a dataset of ∼52,000 igneous whole rock geochemical analyses to quantify secular variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. We find dramatically increasing zircon abundance per mass of magma through geologic time, suggesting that the zircon record underestimates past crustal volume even if preservation bias is eliminated. Similarly, zircons were even less likely to crystallise from low-silica magmas in early Earth history than they are today, together suggesting that the observed Hadean zircon record may require a larger volume of generally felsic Hadean crust than previously expected.<\i>"""
