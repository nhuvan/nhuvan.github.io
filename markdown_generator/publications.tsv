2012-05-24	Statistical geochemistry reveals disruption in secular lithospheric evolution about 2.5 Gyr ago	Nature	My first significant computational work - originally a side project to work on as a grad student while waiting for Blair's clean lab to be built. We were surprised by the strength and consistency of the geochemical trends we observed on Gyr timescales. The simplest signals directly reflect secular mantle cooling, but others hint at a change in crustal evolution that appears to coincide temporally with oxidation of the surface Earth in the Great Oxygenation Event.

Keller-Schoene-2012	https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11024	http://brenhinkeller.github.io/files/KS2012.pdf	"""<i>The Earth has cooled over the past 4.5 billion years (Gyr) as a result of surface heat loss and declining radiogenic heat production. Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archaean geodynamics, but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias. Here we apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of about 70,000 samples from the continental igneous rock record to produce a comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity occurring about 2.5 Gyr ago, involving substantial decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in indicators of deep crustal melting and fractionation, such as Na/K, Eu/Eu* (europium anomaly) and La/Yb ratios in felsic rocks. Along with an increase in preserved crustal thickness across the Archaean/Proterozoic boundary, these data are consistent with a model in which high-degree Archaean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and melting—leading to abundant tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite magmatism and a thin preserved Archaean crust. The coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation at the end of the Archaean eon provides a significant temporal link between deep Earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on the Earth.</i>"""
2015-07-16	Volcanic–plutonic parity and the differentiation of the continental crust	Nature	Here we used the weighted bootstrap resampling approach from our 2012 paper to address the longstanding question of volcanic-plutonic parity. The results indicate that felsic plutons are not (on average) significantly more cumulate than felsic volcanics, favor fractional crystallization as the predominant mechanism of geochemical differentiation, and suggest the influence of magmatic water content on magma stalling and intrusion.

However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical comparison of its primary igneous building blocks—volcanic and plutonic rocks—and the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas, emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation.</i>"""

However, the power of U–Pb zircon dates can be enhanced through complementary characterization of mineral texture and geochemistry, as this permits more detailed interpretations of geochronological datasets than conventionally achieved. Our approach to better relating zircon dates and geological processes consists of a multi-method analytical workflow, including cathodoluminescence imaging (CL), in situ LA-ICPMS/EPMA zircon geochemistry, U–Pb zircon ID-TIMS geochronology, and solution ICPMS zircon Trace Element Analysis (U–Pb TIMS-TEA). These methods are here applied to zircon from the Bergell Intrusion, a composite Alpine pluton preserving a ~ 10 km mid-crustal transect. Hand samples of tonalite, granodiorite and hybridized granitoid each record 250–700 kyr of autocrystic zircon growth. Bergell zircons are ubiquitously zoned with ca. 10^4–10^6 yr growth histories, as evidenced by ID-TIMS analysis of microsampled fragments from single crystals. U–Pb TIMS-TEA data exhibit compositional trends on multiple spatiotemporal scales, including the handsample-scale, representing in situ differentiation at the emplacement level (e.g., Th/U); lithology-scale, defining trajectories corresponding to the production of tonalitic versus granodioritic magmas (Lu/Hf); and pluton-scale, indicating increasingly-evolved melts over ~1.6 Myr of pluton assembly (Zr/Hf). These absolute TIMS-TEA temporal trends are corroborated by relative LA-ICPMS/EPMA core-to-rim geochemistry. We compare records of trace element evolution from TIMS-TEA, Bergell whole-rock geochemistry, and a global compilation of whole-rock geochemical data. These findings support zircon compositional evolution as a robust indicator of differentiation at local and crustal scales, and provide key empirical constraints on melt differentiation and cooling timescales in the middle crust.</i>"""

U-Pb ages indicate that zircon growth within the rhyolite and the dacite-monzonite porphyry magmas was coeval over ∼300 k.y. prior to the large eruptive event. Trends in zircon trace elements (Hf, Y/Dy, Sm/Yb, Eu/Eu*) through time in the dacitic-monzonitic units and rhyolite reflect melt evolution dominated by crystal fractionation. Importantly, the Y/Dy ratio in zircons in both units remains mostly similar for the first ∼150 k.y. of the system’s evolution, but the dominant population in the rhyolitic unit diverges from that of the dacite-monzonite porphyry ∼150 k.y. before eruption. We interpret this divergence in trace element composition to record the assembly time of the melt-rich cap within its intermediate mush zone in the upper crustal reservoir. These results are consistent with (1) a connection between plutonic and volcanic realms in the upper crust, (2) a protracted time scale for constructing an intermediate mush large enough to hold 500 km3 of rhyolite, and (3) the prolonged extraction of that melt prior to eruption.</i>"""

2017-04-20	Temporal variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history	Geochemical Perspectives Letters	We investigate the variation in the amount of zircon expected to saturate from magmas of different ages throughout Earth history. We find that older magmas crystallize substantially less zircon per unit mass due to the geochemical consequences of secular mantle cooling  -- suggesting that a larger volume of felsic magmatism is required to explain the Archean (and perhaps the Hadean) zircon record than previously considered. We note also that anorthosite flotation crust is largely zircon free and thus invisible to zircon-based crustal growth models, with implications explored in the supplement.	C.

However, the quantity of zircon crystallised per unit mass of magma is highly variable, complicating interpretation of the terrestrial zircon record. Here we combine zircon saturation simulations with a dataset of ∼52,000 igneous whole rock geochemical analyses to quantify secular variation in relative zircon abundance throughout Earth history. We find dramatically increasing zircon abundance per mass of magma through geologic time, suggesting that the zircon record underestimates past crustal volume even if preservation bias is eliminated. Similarly, zircons were even less likely to crystallise from low-silica magmas in early Earth history than they are today, together suggesting that the observed Hadean zircon record may require a larger volume of generally felsic Hadean crust than previously expected.</i>"""

Bulk-rock compositional mass balance in the late Miocene Risco Bayo–Huemul plutonic complex (Chile) suggests that lithological differences within the Huemul pluton reflect residual crystal concentration in response to melt extraction. A compositional gap from 70 to 75 wt% SiO2 and strong depletion in Ba and Eu suggest that Huemul alkali feldspar (Afs) granites are frozen remnants of highly evolved rhyolitic melt extracted from a mush. Quartz monzonites enriched in Zr and Ba with Eu/Eu* near unity are interpreted to represent the complementary residual silicic cumulates of this fractionation process. Compositional variations in Afs granite zircon (Eu/Eu*, Dy/Yb) further support extraction of this melt from a zircon-saturated mush. U-Pb zircon dates indicate that Huemul rocks evolved ∼800 k.y. after initial crystallization of more mafic Risco Bayo rocks, likely precluding their evolution via fractionation from mafic forerunners. This pluton records a means to produce rhyolite in the upper crust, which has propelled large silicic eruptions during the Quaternary within the Andean subduction zone.</i>"""

Diffusive growth models predict asymmetric distributions of zircon dates and crystallization temperatures in a cooling magma, with volumetrically abundant old, hot crystallization at Tsat decreasing continuously to volumetrically minor young, cold crystallization at Tsolid. We present integrated geochronological and geochemical data from Bergell Intrusion tonalites (Central Alps, Europe) that document zircon compositional change over hundreds of thousands of years at the hand-sample scale, indicating melt compositional evolution during solidification. Ti-in-zircon thermometry, crystallization simulation using MELTS software, and U-Pb dates produce zircon mass-temperature-time distributions that are in excellent agreement with zircon growth models. These findings provide the first quantitative validation of longstanding expectations from zircon saturation theory by direct geochronological investigation, underscoring zircon’s capacity to quantify supersolidus cooling rates in magmas and resolve dynamic differentiation histories in the plutonic rock record.</i>"""
2018-01-01	Plate tectonics and continental basaltic geochemistry throughout Earth history	Earth and Planetary Science Letters	We examine the basaltic record in more detail, continuing the weighted bootstrap resampling procedure of Keller and Schoene, 2012. A range of rapid trace element variations in the basaltic record can be explained as a result of mantle melting systematics (changing partition coefficients as a result of Grt and Cpx-out). Both trace element signatures of slab fluid input and major element signatures of calc-alkaline vs tholeiitic differentiation are remarkably stable and consistently arc-like, strongly suggesting the occurence of subduction and plate tectonics throughout the preserved rock record (back to at least 3.85 Ga). While some non-plate tectonic models may produce some flux melting, a virtually constant proportion of flux to decompression melting in the preserved continental record is a tall order for any non-plate model for Archean tectonics.

As such, changes in the average basaltic geochemistry through time reflect changes in underlying parameters such as mantle potential temperature and the geodynamic setting of mantle melting. However, sampling bias, preservation bias, and geological heterogeneity complicate the calculation of representative average compositions. Here we use weighted bootstrap resampling to minimize sampling bias over the heterogeneous rock record and obtain maximally representative average basaltic compositions through time. Over the approximately 4 Ga of the continental rock record, the average composition of preserved continental basalts has evolved along a generally continuous trajectory, with decreasing compatible element concentrations and increasing incompatible element concentrations, punctuated by a comparatively rapid transition in some variables such as La/Yb ratios and Zr, Nb, and Ti abundances approximately 2.5 Ga ago. Geochemical modeling of mantle melting systematics and trace element partitioning suggests that these observations can be explained by discontinuous changes in the mineralogy of mantle partial melting driven by a gradual decrease in mantle potential temperature, without appealing to any change in tectonic process. This interpretation is supported by the geochemical record of slab fluid input to continental basalts, which indicates no long-term change in the global proportion of arc versus non-arc basaltic magmatism at any time in the preserved rock record.</i>"""
